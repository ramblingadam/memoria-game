## Memoria

A simple memory game I built for a technical interview using React and TypeScript. I had so much fun making it, that after the interview I just kept going!

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** React, TypeScript, CSS

I built the MVP of this little game on Replit during a technical interview for a frontend position- but after the interview, I just kept on going- adding multiple deck options, randomized card images, local high scores, and a bevy of snazzy animations.

### Features of Magic Task Timer

| *Feature*|*Description*|
|---|---|
| **Deck Selection** | Choose from an emoji image deck or a number deck! |
| **Local High Scores** | Your best times are recorded locally by difficulty level. Can you beat your own record? |
| **Snazzy Style** | The custom CSS animations will surprise and delight you! |

## Optimizations

If I return to this project in the future, I'd like to add:
- More deck types / image themes
- Global leaderboards

## Lessons Learned:

Whlie I came into this project feeling confident with React and TypeScript, this project introduced me to the functional method of updating state- which was necessary to trigger state updates within an interval. This allowed me to make the fun auto-flipping cards in the title- which all flip at randomly determined intervals!
